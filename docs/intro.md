# NFT 2.0 - Decentralized School Database Platform

## Introduction

The NFT 2.0 project represents a transformative approach to harnessing the collective power of the global community to crowd-source data collection, validation and data updating for schools and in the process creating the largest decentralized school database using NFTs.

Giga NFT2.0 aims to solve this problem by crowdsourcing the collection and curation of this missing data and creating a comprehensive database of school information, comparable to a Wikipedia page for each school. By enabling the community surrounding each school to curate and update the data on the NFTs, Giga NFT2.0 hopes to gather accurate and up-to-date information on schools around the world. This will allow Giga to map the need for connectivity more granularly and will help Giga to more effectively connect schools to the internet and provide digital access to young people. Simultaneously, NFT2 will create a way for anyone to contribute data to schools, validate and update this data, and become a Giga Supporter.

## Project Objective

- To use the data that's collected to help accelerate connectivity
- To create a "digital passport" for every school in the world, using NFTs
- To create a crowdsourcing mechanism for collecting missing school data
- To engage the public and local communities in Giga countries in the cause of connecting schools to the internet
